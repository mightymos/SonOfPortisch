# Prerequisites --------------------------------------------------------
#
# Besides make, his project requires: 
#
# - sdcc
# - stcgal-patched
# - minicom
# - doxygen

# Usage ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Build executable in release mode:
#   make
#
# Build executable in debug mode:
#   make BUILD_MODE=debug
#
# Build documentation:
#   make doc
#
# Upload executable to MCU:
#   make upload
#
# Open serial console in new window:
#   make console
#
# Clean project (remove all build files):
#   make clean

# Target MCU settings --------------------------------------------------
# for OB38S003 used in Sonoff v2.2 receivers (white color)
